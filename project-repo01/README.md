# E-Commerce Cloud Architecture Design

## **Overview**
This repository contains the system design documentation and related resources for an e-commerce platform's cloud architecture. The design ensures:
- **High availability** (99.99% uptime) during peak shopping seasons like Black Friday.
- **Scalability** to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.
- **Security** to meet PCI-DSS compliance for protecting customer data.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Load Balancing**: Traffic is distributed across multiple application servers using Amazon ALB or Azure Front Door.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Stateless application servers automatically scale during traffic spikes.
- **High Availability**: Multi-AZ failover and multi-region deployment ensure no single point of failure.
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed data is cached using Amazon ElastiCache or Azure Cache for Redis.
- **Centralized Storage**: Logs, backups, and static assets are securely stored in Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage.
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring and alerts are configured using Amazon CloudWatch or Azure Monitor.

## **How to Use This Repository**

1. **View the Architecture**:
   - Check the `diagrams/` folder for architecture and data flow diagrams.
   - Example: The high-level architecture diagram illustrates the system's major components and interactions.

2. **Read the System Design**:
   - Open the `SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` file for a detailed explanation of the proposed architecture, components, and scaling strategies.
   - Alternatively, download the PDF version from the `docs/` folder.

3. **Infrastructure Configurations**:
   - Use the files in the `infrastructure/` folder to deploy and configure the cloud infrastructure:
     - `terraform/main.tf`: Terraform script for provisioning resources.
     - `kubernetes/deployment.yaml`: Kubernetes configuration for deploying application servers.

## **Requirements**
The system meets the following requirements:
- **Concurrent Users**: Supports up to 10,000 simultaneous users.
- **Availability**: Achieves 99.99% uptime with multi-AZ and multi-region failover.
- **Scalability**: Auto-scales during traffic spikes to ensure consistent performance.
- **Security**: Implements encryption, isolated VPCs, and access control to meet PCI-DSS compliance.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Compute**: AWS EC2 Auto Scaling or Azure VM Scale Sets for stateless application servers.
- **Load Balancing**: Amazon ALB or Azure Front Door.
- **Database**: Amazon RDS or Azure SQL Database with Multi-AZ failover.
- **Caching**: Amazon ElastiCache or Azure Cache for Redis.
- **Storage**: Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage for logs and backups.
- **Monitoring**: Amazon CloudWatch or Azure Monitor for performance tracking.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform and Kubernetes for automated deployments.

## **Future Improvements**
- Add a Content Delivery Network (CDN) like Amazon CloudFront or Azure CDN to reduce latency for global users.
- Implement database read replicas for better read performance.
- Introduce machine learning models for personalized recommendations.
