# E-Commerce Cloud Architecture Design

## **Overview**
This repository contains the system design documentation and related resources for an e-commerce platform's cloud architecture. The design ensures:
- **High availability** (99.99% uptime) during peak shopping seasons like Black Friday.
- **Scalability** to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users.
- **Security** to meet PCI-DSS compliance for protecting customer data.

## **Key Features**
- **Load Balancing**: Traffic is distributed across multiple application servers using Amazon ALB or Azure Front Door.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Stateless application servers automatically scale during traffic spikes.
- **High Availability**: Multi-AZ failover and multi-region deployment ensure no single point of failure.
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed data is cached using Amazon ElastiCache or Azure Cache for Redis.
- **Centralized Storage**: Logs, backups, and static assets are securely stored in Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage.
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring and alerts are configured using Amazon CloudWatch or Azure Monitor.
