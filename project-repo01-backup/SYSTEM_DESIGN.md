# System Design Document: E-Commerce Cloud Architecture

## 1. **Overview**
This document outlines a highly available and scalable cloud architecture for an e-commerce platform. The system is designed to handle peak shopping seasons (e.g., Black Friday) and meet strict compliance requirements, including PCI-DSS for securing customer data.

---

## 2. **Requirements**

### **Functional Requirements**
- Handle up to **10,000 concurrent users**.
- Provide **auto-scaling** to handle traffic spikes.
- Ensure **99.99% availability** for uninterrupted service.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**
- Secure customer data to comply with **PCI-DSS**.
- Optimize performance by caching frequently accessed data.
- Ensure disaster recovery and high availability across **multiple regions**.

---

## 3. **Proposed Solution**

The architecture will use cloud-native services to meet the above requirements. Below is a high-level description of the core components:

### **3.1 Load Balancer**
- **Purpose**: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple regions and application servers.
- **Service**: Amazon Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Azure Front Door.
- **Features**:
  - Health checks to route traffic only to healthy instances.
  - SSL termination to secure customer communication.

### **3.2 Application Layer**
- **Purpose**: Host stateless application servers to handle business logic.
- **Service**: AWS EC2 with Auto Scaling or Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS).
- **Features**:
  - Horizontal scaling to handle traffic spikes.
  - Deployed across multiple **Availability Zones (AZs)** for redundancy.

### **3.3 Database Layer**
- **Purpose**: Store transactional data securely and reliably.
- **Service**: Amazon RDS or Azure SQL Database.
- **Features**:
  - Multi-AZ failover for high availability.
  - Encryption for data at rest and in transit to meet PCI-DSS requirements.

### **3.4 Caching Layer**
- **Purpose**: Improve response time for frequently accessed data.
- **Service**: Amazon ElastiCache (Redis or Memcached) or Azure Cache for Redis.
- **Features**:
  - Caches frequent database queries to reduce load and latency.
  - Fully managed service with high scalability.

### **3.5 Storage Layer**
- **Purpose**: Store logs, backups, and static files.
- **Service**: Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage.
- **Features**:
  - Secure, centralized storage with lifecycle policies for cost optimization.
  - Encryption for sensitive data.

### **3.6 Monitoring and Logging**
- **Purpose**: Monitor performance metrics, logs, and system health.
- **Service**: Amazon CloudWatch or Azure Monitor.
- **Features**:
  - Real-time monitoring and alerting.
  - Centralized logging for troubleshooting.
